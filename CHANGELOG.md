# Changelog

All notable changes to agentctl are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — Road to 1.0

The production-hardening pass (`docs/ROADMAP_1_0.md`). All additions are backward-compatible: the
zero-config demo and the existing test suite are unchanged.

### Added
- **Golden-wire proto conformance suite** (Workstream 4). Cross-runtime verification that the Python
  reference proxy and the Go data plane are wire-compatible on the frozen `Frame` envelope:
  byte-identical frozen header (fields 1–4) + lossless cross-runtime decode in both directions.
  Surfaced and documented that protobuf `deterministic` marshaling is per-runtime, not cross-runtime
  canonical. New: `tests/fixtures/conformance_frames.json`, `tests/conformance_frames.py`,
  `tests/test_conformance.py`, `gateway_core/internal/gateway/conformance{,_test}.go`,
  `gateway_core/cmd/genfixtures`, `make fixtures` / `make conformance`, and
  `docs/design/PROTO_CONFORMANCE.md`. The first Go test in the repo.

<!-- subsequent workstreams appended here as they land: auth/RBAC, pgvector, ClickHouse/Grafana -->

## [0.1.0]

- Initial prototype: three verticals (probabilistic eval-gate, streaming gateway, stateful
  rollback), the Go data-plane cutover, the streaming support-agent demo, and the `agentctl push`
  developer CLI. See `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRD.md`.
